      <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.com/blog/privacy-policy/"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Privacy Policy</span></a><span>. ESX is not a registered or licensed as a broker-dealer, funding portal, investment advisor or investment manager in the United States, in any state, district, county, territory or municipality thereof, or in any other country or territory. As such, it is not acting as in a fiduciary capacity with respect to any user of the ESX Services, and ESX disclaims any broker-client or adviser-client relationship with respect to any party using any Service.</span></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><span>ESX does not provide legal, accounting or tax advice. Any representation or implication to the contrary is expressly disclaimed. You should consult your own legal, accounting and tax experts before using any Service.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>If you want to use the ESX Services</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>Please carefully read these entire Terms (including all links to details), as they constitute a written agreement between you and us and they affect your legal rights and obligations. Each time you access and/or use any Service (other than to simply read these Terms), you agree to be bound by and comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms (defined below) then posted. Therefore, do not use any Service if you do not agree. The business realities associated with operating the ESX Services are such that, without the limitations that are set forth in these Terms, such as your grants and waivers of rights, the limitations on our liability, your indemnity of us, and the arbitration of certain disputes ? we would not make the ESX Services available to you. By accessing and/or using any Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. In some instances, both these Terms and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of use or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of such Service or to a service or product offered via a Service (in each such instance, and collectively, "Additional Terms"). To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, these Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.</span></p>

    <strong dir="ltr"><span>1. Important Notices Applicable to Your Use of the ESX Services:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>It's important that you read the entire Terms but here are some of the more significant notices that we want to bring to your attention at the outset:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>The federal and state securities laws applicable to private company finance are complex. In general, they are designed to protect unsophisticated people from making ill-advised investments. These Terms are designed to minimize the risk to ESX if any unsophisticated/non-accredited individuals try to become investors through the ESX Services, and to protect ESX in the event that anyone claims he, she or it was damaged by using any Service.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>Neither the information nor any opinion expressed on or through any Service constitutes an offer by ESX to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments or provide any investment advice or related services. None of the ESX Services shall be construed as an offer to sell, or as a solicitation of an offer to purchase, any securities. Investments can and do lose money and you should be prepared to lose your entire investment in securities made available on or through the ESX Services.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>The information provided on or through the ESX Services by us or our Users (defined below) about investment opportunities may not be available to or suitable for you. Not all strategies are appropriate at all times. ESX is not obligated to perform, and has not performed, an analysis of investor suitability with respect to the investments in securities made available on or through the ESX Services.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>The opinions expressed on or through the ESX Services by us or our Users do not constitute investment advice. Independent advice should be sought in all cases before investing in securities made available on or through the ESX Services.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>The value and income of any of the securities made available on or through the ESX Services by us or Users can fall as well as rise and an investor may get back less than he or she invested or nothing at all. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>The securities made available on or through the ESX Services may often have tax consequences; therefore, it is important to bear in mind that we do not provide tax advice. The levels and bases of taxation can change. Investors' tax affairs are their own responsibility and investors should consult their own attorneys or other tax advisors in order to understand the tax consequences of any securities made available on or through the ESX Services.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>ESX does not endorse or recommend any of the Companies (defined below) or securities made available on or through the ESX Services. However, from time-to-time ESX may invest in some deals featured on or through the ESX Services, in its sole discretion, but ESX does not invest in all deals.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>ESX does not conduct any diligence or review of Companies or securities made available on or through the ESX Services before Companies are permitted to raise funds using the ESX Services. ESX does not provide legal advice. You are encouraged to seek legal counsel prior to investing using any Service.</span></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>2. Summary of the ESX Services:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>By accessing or using any Service in any manner, you become a ESX user ("User"). Users who have a business or commercial-related enterprise ("Company") that they wish to have funded may elect to create a profile for their company ("Company Profile"). Each User who creates a Company Profile becomes a founder for that Company (a "Founder"). ESX is an intermediary funding platform that brings together Companies and prospective investors. Users use the ESX Services to learn about, help, advise, create profiles for, browse, and/or fund Companies who have posted or advertised a Raise (defined below). ESX is a platform where Users can interact, network, learn about, and connect with other Users. ESX is a platform that permits Founders to offer and sell securities in their Companies directly or indirectly (the "Accredited Platform"), which may be accessed at</span>
      <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.com/company/edit/hoo/www.crowdfunder.com"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>ESX.com. An affiliate of ESX manages the VC Index fund (the "Index Fund"), where Companies who would like to seek an investment from the Index Fund, can be considered when creating a Company Profile or posting a Raise (defined below).</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>3. Accredited Platform:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>The Accredited Platform permits entrepreneurs seeking angel financing to create and populate a deal tab (a "Raise") and interact and communicate with and meet other Founders, potential mentors, advisors, and accredited investors (a "Accredited Investors") as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Users can either invest directly in a Company by purchasing securities issued by the Company ("Direct Raise") or invest indirectly by purchasing securities issued by an investment fund (also known as a syndicate) (referred to herein as an "Investment Fund"), a separate limited liability company created for the sole purpose of investing in the Company. Investors in the Investment Fund are not the record or beneficial shareholders of the Company in which such Investment Fund invests but instead become investors in the Investment Fund. The Investment Fund is managed by an investment manager, managing member, general partner or similar managing entity in accordance with the terms of its operating documents. In an Investment Fund, the investment manager, managing member, general partner or similar managing entity manages, controls, and conducts the affairs of the Investment Fund and exercises any management rights negotiated with the Company in which such Investment Fund invests. Investors in an Investment Fund do not have the same voting rights in Companies as investors in a Direct Raise, and may or may not have redemption or withdrawal rights pursuant to the provisions under the Investment Fund's operating documents. Investors in an Investment Fund may be charged an administrative fee to cover the actual out-of-pocket costs of the Investment Fund; the administrative fee is disclosed to the investors at the time of the Investment Fund formation. Investors in an Investment Fund may receive distributions only when and if determined by the investment manager, managing member, general partner or similar managing entity and not necessarily upon a distribution or payment of dividends by the Company in which such Investment Fund has invested. Investors in an Investment Fund have the benefit of the managing entity's experience in securities or related transactions. A managing entity may receive a share of any profit of the Investment Fund for providing management services ("carried interest") and/or an "assets under management" fee, but may not receive any transaction based fees such as commissions relating to the sale of interests in such Investment Fund. Terms may vary between Investment Funds so you are strongly encouraged to read all offering materials carefully and consult with your legal, financial and investment counsel. The managing entity for offerings in Investment Funds posted on or through the ESX Services may be an affiliate of ESX. The foregoing description of Investment Funds is not exhaustive, is superseded in all respects by the terms of such Investment Funds' offering materials themselves, and should not be deemed to be legal advice. ESX does not recommend or otherwise suggest that any investor make an investment in a particular Company or Investment Fund, or that any Company or Investment Fund offer securities to a particular investor. Except with respect to the Index Fund, where an affiliate of ESX takes part in the negotiation or execution of transactions for the sale of securities by the Index Fund, no transactions are executed on or through the ESX Services. ESX, however, provides a place for Users, Founders, service providers, and others to interact and share information.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>4. Non-Accredited Investors &amp; Regulation A+:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>A. Non-Accredited Investors. Notwithstanding any to the contrary in these Terms, the securities made available on or through the ESX Services are only available to: (i) Accredited Investors or (ii) non-accredited investors subject to certain limitations as set forth under Regulation A (commonly referred to as "Reg A+") under the Securities Act ("Reg A+ Qualified Purchasers"). If you intend to invest in an offering under Reg A+, you must represent that you will meet the investment thresholds under Tier 2 of Reg A+ for Reg A+ Qualified Purchasers. Prior to investing, you may be asked to fill out a certification and provide necessary documentation as proof of your income and/or net worth to verify that you are qualified to invest in securities made available on or through the ESX Services. You acknowledge and agree that all information you provide for the registration will be complete and accurate. By registering with the ESX Services for purposes of subscribing for securities offered to non-Accredited Investors in any Reg. A+ offering, you represent and warrant that your investment in any such offering shall not exceed the greater of 10% of your annual income or 10% of your net worth (excluding the value of your primary residence) at the time of such investment. YOU MUST MEET ONE OF THE ABOVE CRITERIA. WE ARE ENTITLED TO AND WILL RELY UPON YOUR REPRESENTATIONS. B. Reg A+ Offerings. Federal securities law requires securities offered and sold in the United States to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), unless the offer and sale qualifies for an exemption. In certain cases, the securities made available on or through the ESX Services have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance on the exemption promulgated under Reg A+. In a Reg A+ offering, Issuers (defined below) may advertise or market their offerings via "testing the waters" communications to the general public, or pay third parties to do so, subject to certain conditions. Federal law requires that Issuers sell Reg A+ securities to Reg A+ Qualified Purchasers who represent they satisfy the investment requirements before accepting subscriptions, among other requirements. Each Issuer is solely responsible for ensuring that its securities offering, including, without limitation, the use of the ESX Services to offer and sell securities, satisfies the determination of whether an investor is a Reg. A+ Qualified Purchaser and whether any investment complies with applicable state and Federal securities laws, rules and regulations. All Issuers utilizing the ESX Services hereby agree that they (and not the ESX Services) are responsible for determining and verifying whether a potential investor is a Reg. A+ Qualified Purchaser prior to accepting subscriptions. Users are strongly encouraged to contact each Issuer directly to discuss any questions regarding an offering or the business prospects of the Issuer. By accessing and using the non-accredited portion of the ESX Services, you agree as of any such time: (i) that you meet the requirements outlined in Section 4 above, (ii) that all information you input or agree to is accurate and complete, and (iii) to be bound by these Terms.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>5. Service Content, Ownership, Limited License and Rights of Others</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>A. Content. The ESX Services contain a variety of: (i) materials and other items relating to ESX and its products and services, and similar items from our licensors and other third parties, including all layout, information, articles, posts, text, data, files, images, scripts, designs, graphics, button icons, instructions, illustrations, photographs, audio clips, music, sounds, pictures, videos, advertising copy, URLs, technology, software, interactive features, the "look and feel" of the ESX Services, and the compilation, assembly, and arrangement of the materials of the ESX Services and any and all copyrightable material (including source and object code); (ii) trademarks, trade dress, logos, trade names, service marks, and/or trade identities of various parties, including those of ESX (collectively, "Trademarks"); and (iii) other forms of intellectual property (all of the foregoing, collectively, "Content"). B. Ownership. The ESX Services (including past, present, and future versions) and the Content are owned or controlled by ESX, our licensors and/or certain other third parties. All right, title, and interest in and to the Content available on or through the ESX Service is the property of ESX or our licensors or certain other third parties, and is protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent, and/or other intellectual property and unfair competition rights and laws to the fullest extent possible. ESX owns the copyright in the selection, compilation, assembly, arrangement, and enhancement of the Content on the ESX Services. C. Limited License. Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms and any Additional Terms, ESX grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to download (temporary storage only), display, view, use, play, and/or print one copy of the Content (excluding source and object code in raw form or otherwise, other than as made available to access and use to enable display and functionality) on a personal computer, mobile phone or other wireless device, or other Internet enabled device (each, a "Device") for your personal, non-commercial use only. The foregoing limited license: (i) does not give you any ownership of, or any other intellectual property interest in, any Content, and (ii) may be immediately suspended or terminated for any reason, in ESX's sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. In some instances, we may permit you to have greater access to and use of Content, subject to certain Additional Terms. D. Rights of Others. When using any Service, you must respect the intellectual property and other rights of ESX and others. Your unauthorized use of Content may violate copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, communications, and other laws, and any such use may result in your personal liability, including potential criminal liability. If you believe that your work has been infringed by means of an improper posting or distribution of it on or through any Service, then please see</span>
      <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.com/company/edit/hoo/investment#22"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Section 22</span></a><span>&nbsp;below.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>6. Eligibility for Use of ESX Services:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>The ESX Services are available only to individuals who are at least eighteen (18) years old or the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence. You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are at least eighteen (18) years old and the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, that you are fully able and competent to enter into the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms and other agreements relating to the use of the ESX Services, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. If you are a Founder with an entity or if you are an entity applying to conduct a Raise using the ESX Services, you represent and warrant that the Raise is being conducted by a legal U.S. entity, including, but not limited to, limited liability companies, corporations, and limited liability partnerships and that such entity is registered to conduct business in its state of incorporation/formation. ESX may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer any Service to any person or entity and ESX may, in its sole discretion, change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the ESX Services is revoked in those jurisdictions. ESX welcomes U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. However, it is ESX's policy to not allow non-U.S. residents to invest in offerings made available on or through the ESX Services due to the complexities of complying with securities laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. ESX may in the future make exceptions to this policy on a deal by deal, or investor by investor basis, where listed Companies can provide adequate assurances of compliance with applicable non-U.S. laws, rules and regulations. In these limited instances, the terms and conditions of non-U.S. investor participation may be included on the particular deal page.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>7. User Content:</span></strong>

    <strong dir="ltr"><span>12. Accredited Platform Rules:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>By applying for access to the Accredited Platform portion of the ESX Services, you represent that you are a professional who understands risk and are willing to bear the consequences. You promise to act responsibly when using the Accredited Platform portion of the ESX Services, and you promise to conduct yourself in a professional manner in all your interactions with ESX and any User of the ESX Services. If you are not a Founder looking for an introduction to potential Accredited Investors or you do not think that you are both an Accredited Investor and sophisticated enough to protect your own interests, then you should not access the investment portion of the ESX Services as it pertains to the Accredited Platform. You are strongly advised to consult appropriate counsel before investing. You acknowledge that meeting the Accredited Investor standard does not mean that investing in a private placement securities is suitable for your individual financial position and risk profile. Federal securities law requires securities offer and sold in the United States to be registered with the SEC, unless the offer and sale qualifies for an exemption. Generally, start-up ventures use one or more of the "private placement" exemptions because such exemptions allow them to raise capital without complying with the costly and time-consuming registration process. One such "private placement" exemption under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D ("506(b) offering") requires that neither the company which is offering its securities nor any person acting on the company's behalf may offer or sell the securities by any form of "general solicitation" or "general advertising." Accordingly, ESX only permits visibility of 506(b) offerings to investors who have certified themselves or are verified as "accredited investors." Securities offerings posted on the Accredited Platform may also be made pursuant to a second "private placement" exemption under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D ("506(c) offering") that allows "general solicitation" and "general advertising" during securities offerings as long as the issuing company takes reasonable steps to verify that all purchasers are Accredited Investors. You are responsible for complying with any and all Federal securities laws, as well as state blue sky laws and filings. By applying for access to the Accredited Platform of the ESX Services as in investor, you agree: (i) that you are an Accredited Investor, (ii) that all information you input or agree to is accurate and complete, and (iii) to be bound by these Terms.</span></p>

      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>We may require any User of ESX Services who identify himself/herself/itself as an Accredited Investor to execute an Accredited Investor Questionnaire and related documents. Federal law requires that a Company issuing securities in a Direct Raise or an Investment Fund issuing securities in the Investment Fund ("Issuer") verify Users' status as an Accredited Investor before accepting subscription. Users agree to cooperate with any requests for additional information. In these documents, an Accredited Investor warrants that it is an Accredited Investor and has the necessary knowledge and sophistication to evaluate companies, opportunities, and content. We do not verify its representations, either in a Direct Raise or an Investment Fund. The questionnaire will be maintained by us in a file that is available for inspection by the appropriate Federal agency. Accredited Investors understand, acknowledge and agree that other parties are relying on the statements made herein and that any willfully false statement is sufficient cause for removal from the ESX Services, rejection of Accredited Investor status on the Accredited Platform, along with other legal causes of action. All Founders and investment managers utilizing the ESX.com domain hereby agree that it is their responsibility, as the Founder of a Company or investment manager of an Investment Fund, to determine whether an Investor is an Accredited Investor in the event they decide to enter into a transaction with that investor. Issuers may not rely on ESX's designation of a User as an Accredited Investor as sufficient to meet their obligations for a 506(c) offering.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>As an Accredited Investor using the ESX Services, you also are agreeing to certain representations, warranties and agreements relating to the any potential interaction with an Issuer or Company on ESX or the purchase of securities by you from a potential Founder, Company or Investment Fund in a transaction ("Transaction"). You agree that:</span></p>

    <strong dir="ltr"><span>15. Securities Products:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>The securities offered on the Accredited Platform may only be acquired by Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risks associated with private investments. Securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded and, therefore, are illiquid unless registered with the SEC. Additionally, securities may be subject to holding period requirements. Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments. Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment. For those reasons, these offerings may be made available only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee. The securities being offered have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance, among other exemptions, on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D under the Securities Act. No assurance can be given that any offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under one or more of such exemptive provisions due to, among other things, the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or a change of any securities law or regulation that has retroactive effect. Again, we strongly advise you to consult a legal, tax and financial professional before investing.</span></p>

        <p dir="ltr"><span>Founders acknowledge and accept that as part of building a robust business community, ESX needs to ensure that it is the most appropriate crowdfunding solution for Users. For a variety of reasons, there are certain business segments that are difficult for ESX to assess, and therefore, ESX will not support on the ESX Services. Therefore, companies related to or offering guns, firearms, tobacco, cigarettes, pyramid marketing, gambling, contests, raffles, or any illegal activities are not be permitted on the ESX Services. ESX only supports for-profit companies. ESX may not support Companies or Raises or businesses that are simultaneously running crowdfunding campaigns on other crowdfunding platforms.</span></p>

        <p dir="ltr"><span>Founders acknowledge and agree that by submitting a Company Profile or Raise on ESX, that the Founder is representing and warranting that Founder or the company for which Founder is submitting the Raise ("Raise Company") owns or licenses the rights to produce, sell or promote the products and services in which it engages. Founder and its affiliated Raise Company agree to indemnify and hold harmless ESX (including its affiliates) from any and all claims, threats, allegations, or suits related to a failure of a Raise Company to have the rights to produce, create, distribute, sell or otherwise transact in its goods and services.</span></p>

        <p dir="ltr"><span>ESX is not liable for any damages or loss incurred related to Raises or any other use of any Service. ESX is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between any Users, or between Users and any third party. This includes, but is not limited to, delivery of goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with Raises on or through the ESX Services.

        <p dir="ltr"><span>Confidentiality: By becoming a member of ESX, or otherwise using any Service or viewing Content made available on or through any Service in any way, you may have an opportunity to see Private Information. "Private Information" means all information acquired by, through or in connection with your use of a Service that was provided by you or another person and which you or another person identified as "Private" in any manner reasonably designed to identify the character of such information. Investors may see that information depending on the access you grant them. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to display information you have designated as "Private" only to Investors to whom have explicitly given permission to, but make no promises to this effect. We cannot, for instance, require all Investors who see your Private Information to agree not to distribute that information. We also cannot guarantee that there will never be a software bug or a hacker attack that will allow the unauthorized viewing of material, or that Investors actually fit within any category.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>If you are a Founder, you are welcome to upload information about your business, including information you consider confidential. We offer you three (3) areas in which you can upload your Company information. The first is what all Users will see in your Company Profile. In this information, under no circumstances may you solicit investment. The second view is what Users that warrant that they are Accredited Investors view upon entering the ESX Services. The third view is what Users that warrant that they are accredited view after they have requested access to information you have deemed Private.</span></p>

      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>If you are an Accredited Investor or you are otherwise able to see any material that has been designated as confidential regardless of whether it is designated as Private, you must recognize that it is important to use discretion in how you handle that Private Information. A Founder may request that you sign a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement prior to viewing the information. You will also want to select what kinds of Founders you would like an introduction to and what kinds of business plans you would like to see. We do not promise to show you all qualifying business plans, nor can we promise that all business plans that we show you will actually satisfy your criteria.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>It is expected that you will use discretion in determining what you do with such Private Information. You agree, however, that you will not republish any Information you acquire on or through any Service via an Internet website, one of the principal purposes of which is to compete with ESX.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr"><span>Moreover, if in the course of asking for information related to your status as an Accredited Investor or a Reg. A+ Qualified Purchaser, we ask you personal questions regarding your net worth and your income, we will do our best to keep any specific information you provide confidential; however, Users may still be able to infer certain facts about income and net worth from your qualification as an investor through the ESX Services.</span></p>

Each Issuer warrants and represents that it has exercised reasonable care to determine whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event. The Issuer has complied, to the extent applicable, with its disclosure obligations under Rule 506(e), and agrees to promptly notify ESX in writing should any Disqualifying Events occur or prior Disqualifying Events come to the Issuer's notice despite its (prior) reasonable efforts to discover.

    <strong dir="ltr"><span>20. Fees and Payments:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>A. Generally. Joining ESX is free. However, we may charge fees for certain services. When you use a Service that has a fee associated with it, you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Changes to fees are effective after we provide you with notice by posting the changes on the Site. You are responsible for paying all fees and taxes associated with your use of the ESX Services. To purchase any Services, you must be at least eighteen (18) years of age or the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence. Prior to the purchase of any Service, you may be required to provide us or our credit card processing company with a valid credit card number and associated payment information, including all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) your credit card number, (iii) the credit card type, (iv) the date of expiration, and (v) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card. By submitting that information to us or directly to our credit card processor, you hereby agree that you authorize us and/or our processor (as applicable) to charge your card at our convenience but within thirty (30) days of credit card authorization. For any Service that you order, you agree to pay the price applicable (including any sales taxes and surcharges) as of the time you submit the order. We will automatically bill your credit card or other form of payment submitted as part of the order process for such price. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering. B. Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes. All payments must be made through Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express (or other form of payment specifically accepted on the Site) and also be in a currency permitted to be used on the Site. We currently do not accept cash, personal or business checks or any other payment form for ESX Services, although in the future we may change this policy. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You hereby represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so. YOU, AND NOT US, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. For example, if you purchase with a credit card that is issued through a bank that is based outside of the United States, your bank or our bank may charge foreign transaction fees and other similar currency exchange fees and you agree to reimburse us for any such fees or charges, if charged to us, upon our demand. Unless you notify us of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes. If we do not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us or its agents. Sales taxes, or other taxes, customs, import/export charges, or similar governmental charges are not included in the price of the products. You are responsible for paying any such taxes or charges imposed on your purchases, including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added taxes. We shall automatically charge and withhold the applicable tax for orders to be delivered to addresses within and any states or localities that it deems is required in accordance with our order policy in effect at the time of purchase. C. Return Policy. All purchases of Services are subject to our return policy in effect at the time of purchase. Our current return policy does not permit any returns at this time. D. Order Acceptance Policy. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We further reserve the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your order will be deemed accepted by us upon our delivery of the ESX Services that you have ordered. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: (a) we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been charged for the order); or (b) we will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided. Do not assume that a cancellation or change of an order you have placed with us has been effected until you receive a confirmation from us via email or the ESX Services. As stated above, you will be responsible for, and your credit card or third-party payment account may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders already processed or shipped before your cancellation/change request or a request to terminate your account was received. E. No Responsibility to Sell Mispriced Products or Services. We do our best to describe every item, product or service offered by us as accurately as possible. However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that specifications or pricing of the ESX Services is complete, accurate, reliable, current or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications of any item, product or service, we have the right to refuse or cancel any orders, in our sole discretion. If we charged your credit card or other account prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge. Additional terms may apply. F. Modifications to Prices or Billing Terms. The purchase of Services is subject to availability. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DISPLAYED ON THE SITE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES AND MAY BE SUBSTITUTED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE OUR PRICES AND BILLING METHODS FOR SERVICES SOLD, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING ON THE SITE OR BY E-MAIL DELIVERY TO YOU.</span></p>

The inclusion on another website of any link to the ESX Services does not imply endorsement by or affiliation with ESX.

    <p dir="ltr"><span>IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF ANY SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER SUBMISSION PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY ESX (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER SUBMISSIONS) OR A LICENSOR OF ESX.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>25. Updates to Terms:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable Services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR SERVICES EVOLVE, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER SUCH SERVICES MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING SUCH SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE A SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF ANY SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the posted terms of use and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use a Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used a Service will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently check the home page and the email you associated with your Registration Account for notices, and you agree that the means set forth in these Terms are all reasonable manners of providing you with notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the ESX Services and related services.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>26. Indemnification:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>By using and/or accessing the ESX Services, and by consenting to these Terms, you agree to defend (at ESX's option), indemnify, and hold harmless ESX, its parent company, affiliates and subsidiaries, and each of its their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, managers, agents, vendors, licensors, licensees, contractors, partners and suppliers, and successors and assigns from and against any and all liabilities, lawsuits, actions (civil, criminal, government or otherwise), claims, damages, losses, costs, investigations (such as by local, state, and federal government agencies like the SEC), judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that directly or indirectly arise from or are related to: (i) any offering, investment opportunity, Raise, Direct Raise, Transaction, and Information (as such terms are defined in the these Terms) posted or otherwise associated with you, your Company or your Registration Account on the ESX Services, (ii) your User Submissions; (iii) your use of the ESX Services and your activities in connection with the ESX Services; (iv) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms or any Additional Terms; (v) your violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances, or orders of any governmental or quasi-governmental authorities in connection with your use of the ESX Service or your activities in connection with the ESX Services; (vi) information or material transmitted through your Device, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (vii) any misrepresentation made by you; and (viii) ESX's use of the information that you submit to us (including your User Submissions) (all of the foregoing, "Claims and Losses"). ESX reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with ESX in asserting any available defenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ESX retains the exclusive right to settle, compromise, and pay any and all Claims and Losses. You will not settle any Claims and Losses without, in each instance, the prior written consent of an officer of ESX.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>27. Limitation of Liability:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ESX, ITS AFFILIATES, NOR EACH OF ITS AFFILIATES' DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS, OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SERVICE: (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00). SOME STATES OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Users further understand and expressly agree that all rights under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of California ("Section 1542") and any similar law of any state or territory of the United States that may be applicable with respect to the foregoing release are hereby expressly and forever waived. You acknowledge that Section 1542 provides that: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." The releases hereunder are intended to apply to all claims not known or suspected to exist with the intent of waiving the effect of laws requiring the intent to release future unknown claims.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>28. Governing Law and Arbitration:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>Certain portions of this Section 28 are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and ESX agree that we intend that this Section 28 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. A. First ? Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to any Service, the Content, your User Submissions, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, "Dispute"), or to any of ESX's actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an "Excluded Dispute", which includes those actions set forth in Section 28(D), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 28(A). Your notice to us must be sent via email to: info@ESX.com. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, ESX and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or ESX to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and ESX, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable. B. Binding Arbitration. If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 28(A) (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND ESX (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT? INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR NEGLIGENCE,?COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PURCHASED FROM US OR ADVERTISING AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH ANY SERVICE. The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between ESX and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the ESX Services, including the "No Class Action Matters" Section below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY. ESX and you agree, however, that the applicable state, federal or provincial law, as contemplated in Section 28(H) below, shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies, and damages arising between you and ESX regarding these Terms and the ESX Services, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to any jurisdiction's choice of law principles. Any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules ("Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), except as modified herein, and the arbitration will be administered by the AAA. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to set a hearing then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of ESX consent to in writing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in Los Angeles, California. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require ESX to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 28 to be enforceable, then ESX will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who will apply and be bound by these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions are for the court to decide. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the ESX Services. You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: AAA: 800.778.7879 and</span>
      <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.com/company/edit/hoo/www.adr.org"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>http://www.adr.org</span></a><span>&nbsp;and JAMS: 800.352.5267 and</span>
      <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.com/company/edit/hoo/www.jamsadr.com"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>http://www.jamsadr.com</span></a><span>. C. Limited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 28(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES ? OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. Commencing means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Section 28(A); (b) filing for arbitration as set forth in Section 28(B); or (c) filing an action in state or Federal court. D. Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 28 will not apply to any legal action taken by ESX to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to any Service, any Content, your User Submission and/or ESX's intellectual property rights (including such ESX may claim that may be in dispute), ESX's operations, and/or ESX's products or services. E. No Class Action Matters. YOU AND ESX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 28(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 28(F). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 28, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this "No Class Action Matters" section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions. F. Jurisdictional Issues. Except where arbitration is required above or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted, in state or Federal court in State of California in Los Angeles County. Accordingly, you and ESX consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters. G. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction. H. Governing Law. These Terms and any Additional Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.</span></p>

If you sign electronically, you represent that you have the ability to access and retain a record of such documents.

You are obligated to review the ESX Services periodically for changes and modifications and agree not to contest the admissibility or enforceability the Site's electronically stored copy of these Terms in any proceeding arising out of these Terms. Although you consent to electronic delivery, you may elect to deliver communications by other means and such delivery shall not affect your consent. You may revoke consent to electronic delivery of communications and receive a paper version at your election. ESX shall have a reasonable period to effect such a change and ESX may charge you a reasonable fee for sending such paper copies. If you elect to use electronic delivery, you agree and represent that you have a suitable computer with Internet access, an email address and the availability to download, save and/or print communications to retain a record of such communications. You agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining such equipment and services required for online access.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>31. Integration and Severability:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>These Terms and other referenced material are the entire agreement between you and ESX with respect to the ESX Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and ESX with respect to the ESX Services and govern the future relationship. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.</span></p>
    <strong dir="ltr"><span>32. Miscellaneous:</span></strong>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>ESX shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where the failure results from any cause beyond ESX's reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic, or communications failure or degradation. The Terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with ESX's prior written consent. ESX may assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to the Terms. ESX reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of any Service security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any Additional Terms, (iii) investigate any information obtained by ESX in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with criminal laws, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue any Service, in whole or in part, or, except as may be expressly set forth in any Additional Terms, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party.
